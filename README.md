# rust-completion

False Hope HERE.

## ideas

* use rustdoc plugin to handle std crates http://andelf.github.io/blog/2014/04/29/a-rustdoc-plugin/
* use ``syntax``, ``rustc`` as tokenizer and parser.

## For Standard Library

* extract ``path`` and its corresponding ``type``
* extract ``type`` and its corresponding ``field``s and ``method``s
